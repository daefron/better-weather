## About this project

This is a visual weather explorer that helps you find better weather nearby, powered by Open-Meteo and Google Maps.

It fetches hourly forecasts for surrounding locations and plots them on a map.

## Why this project

It was cold, wet, and the suburb Iâ€™d planned a day trip to was also miserable.

I figured somewhere nearby had to have better weather, but checking the forecast for every possible location manually was a pain. So I built a tool that does the searching for you.

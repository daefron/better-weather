## About this project

This is an app that allows you to compare weather from nearby locations to a selected location.

It's main purpose is to be able to see if there is anywhere within driving distance with better weather.

## Why this project

The weather was bad, and I was sick of having to check the forecase of every potential area I wanted to go to.
